# helloStrings

helloStrings could be a forum, with a name inspired by Shi Tiesheng's《strings of life》.
The back end is [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), also using [gorm](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm) to interact with database. And the [front end](https://github.com/bridge71/helloStrings-FrontEnd) uses vue3 with [naiveUI](https://www.naiveui.com) and [primevue](https://primevue.org/editor/).
